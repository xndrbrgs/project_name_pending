## API Reference
- **Google Geocoding API**: Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map. The Geocoding API provides a direct way to access these services via an HTTP request. The following example uses the Geocoding service through the Maps JavaScript API to demonstrate the basic functionality. [Google Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)

- **Google Places API**: The Places API is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests. Places are defined within this API as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest.
